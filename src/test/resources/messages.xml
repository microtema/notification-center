        <title>React A JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY FOR BUILDING USER INTERFACES</title>
        <description>JUST THE UI Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. Since React makes no assumptions about the
            rest of your technology stack, it's easy to try it out on a small feature in an existing project. VIRTUAL
            DOM React abstracts away the DOM from you, giving a simpler programming model and better performance. React
            can also render on the server using Node, and it can power native apps using React Native. DATA FLOW React
            implements one-way reactive data flow which reduces boilerplate and is easier to reason about than
            traditional data binding.

        <title>HTML5</title>
        <description>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It
            was finalized, and published, on 28 October 2014 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).[2][3] This is the
            fifth revision of the HTML standard since the inception of the World Wide Web. The previous version, HTML 4,
            was standardized in 1997. Its core aims are to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia
            while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices (web
            browsers, parsers, etc.). HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2
            HTML.[4] Following its immediate predecessors HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.1, HTML5 is a response to the fact that
            the HTML and XHTML in common use on the World Wide Web have a mixture of features introduced by various
            specifications, along with those introduced by software

        <title>Apache Camel</title>
        <description>Apache Camel is a rule-based routing and mediation engine that provides a Java object-based
            implementation of the Enterprise Integration Patterns using an API (or declarative Java Domain Specific
            Language) to configure routing and mediation rules. The domain-specific language means that Apache Camel can
            support type-safe smart completion of routing rules in an integrated development environment using regular
            Java code without large amounts of XML configuration files, though XML configuration inside Spring is also
            supported. Camel is often used with Apache ServiceMix, Apache ActiveMQ and Apache CXF in service-oriented
            architecture infrastructure projects.
